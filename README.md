# BSOR---Linear-Equation-Solver
## About The Project

This project was created as the submission for course Numerical Methods (Metody Numeryczne). 
The objective was to solve linear equations Ax = b, where A is tridiagonal matrix stored as a 3 x n matrix where n is the size of A using BSOR method. Additionaly this was tested for other parameters and all tests were visualised. 
I encourage to read the pdf file where all tests and further descrpitions were written.
